## Deploying to Heroku 

In the root directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This corresponds to the start script in the root package.json. Currently, this start script only deploys the Node.js backend, but another command can be added to deploy the React frontend.
The script is the command used by Heroku to deploy, thus only the backend is deployed at this time.

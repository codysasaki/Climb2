I'm a 2nd-year CS student and I enjoy basketball. 
Our project will design a scorecard to simplify judging and verification of scores - I believe we should have different access levels dependent on levelin the competition (e.g. judge versus competitor) and be able to register for competitions from a dropdown menu.

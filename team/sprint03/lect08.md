Designed the SQL database according the specifications from the scrum on Lect07.

Created two tables:
<ul>
      <li> competitions  -> name | routes | scores | date </li>
      <li> users         -> name | password | competition_scores </li>
</ul>    
Added this database to heroku.

We plan to follow the MVC pattern to display database records on our front end.

Only roadblock at the moment is understanding how the team can work around only one heroku account.

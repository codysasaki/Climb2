Maven Jones, a 3rd year UCSB student on the climbing team, has recently become a staffer for climbing competitions. After the first competition of the season, Maven realizes how frustrating and unreliable it is to use the current paper scorecards for competitions. As a former competitor and current staff member, Maven has dealt with inaccuracies in scoring data, excessive paperwork, and wasted time and labor in calculating scores and standings. Maven would like a digital climbing scorecard to streamline the process of running and participating in competitions by  accurately logging scores, automatically computing standings, and preserving the integrity of a competition. Maven has not yet found a medium to facilitate his goals and desires that one be created.

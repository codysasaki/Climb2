# Daily Scrum Lecture 05

Scribe: Albert Li

Ganesh: Since our last meeting, I opened an issue to create a hello world program in React. I pushed the basic program onto the repo and created an issue to separate the front end and backend into different repos. I don't see any repos

Michael: I did basically the same thing as Ganesh. I created a hello world on React.js for the front end. I pushed it onto the repo. 

Cody: I reviewed the frameworks and I look forward to start working on this project.

Johnson: I have nothing to add to the front-end group as everything has been covered.

Tim: I have written a hello world code in node.js and pushed it to the repo.

Sumeet: I created a basic hello world program in node.js which displays hello world at localhost:300

Albert: I also created a hello world program in node.js.

I am a second year CS student here at UCSB. I also like to climb in my free time and enjoy nature and trees. <br/> <br/>
<strong>My Ideas
- Users can create a competition which generates a join code
- Other users can join. Upon joining, users are given a special randomly generated key (used as a signature)
- Competitors can begin recording climbs that they complete. To register a climb, you have to get two peoples signatures (their randomly generated keys)
- Staff ends comp and whosever top three climbs add up to the highest number win
<br/><br/>Planning to use Javascript to create a RESTful API for the backend server and a webapp for the frontend

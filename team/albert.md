<strong>Me!</strong>

I like climbing and CS.

<strong>My Project Idea</strong>

My interpretation of this project is that we aim to replace the paper scorecards presently used with an app.

<ul>
  <li>Upon opening the app, the user is prompted to either create an event/competition or to join one using a code.</li>
  <li>Each user should have some unique ID that can be used as their user signiture</li>
  <li>Any submission to the webapp will then use java script to communicate with the backend</li>
  <li>We should also make it look pleasing</li>
